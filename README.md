# Faux GNOME Screensaver #

A GNOME compatibility layer for XScreenSaver  
<https://github.com/jefferyto/faux-gnome-screensaver>  
v0.3.0

## UNMAINTAINED ##

This almost certainly does not work anymore.

## Purpose ##

Faux GNOME Screensaver (FGS) adds several features to bridge the gap
between [XScreenSaver][] and GNOME 3:

*   FGS implements GNOME Screensaver's D-Bus interface. This allows, for
    instance, the **Lock** function in Ubuntu's session menu to
    correctly trigger XScreenSaver.

*   FGS obeys idle inhibition requests in the GNOME Session Manager.
    This allows programs like [Caffeine][] to request that the session
    not be marked as idle, thus preventing XScreenSaver from activating.

    *   If XScreenSaver is manually activated and locked, FSG will stop
        making deactivation requests so that the lock screen password
        prompt does not appear repeatedly.

*   FGS ensures that GNOME is configured to put XScreenSaver in control
    of screensaver activation and display power management.

*   FGS listens for signals (Lock, Unlock, etc.) from ConsoleKit and
    systemd-logind, and acts appropriately.

The current version is developed for Ubuntu 13.10; it should work for
earlier versions of Ubuntu, though no testing has been done. Users of
Ubuntu 12.10 / 13.04 may want to use [v0.2.0][] instead. Feedback (and
patches) for other distros would also be appreciated.

All bug reports, feature requests and miscellaneous comments are welcome
at the [project issue tracker][].

## Requirements ##

*   XScreenSaver
*   python-gi and python-dbus

## Installation ##

1.  Uninstall GNOME Screensaver:

        sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver

2.  Install XScreenSaver and dependencies:

        sudo apt-get install xscreensaver xscreensaver-gl-extra xscreensaver-data-extra python-gi python-dbus

3.  Download the source code (as [zip][] or [tar.gz][]) and extract.

4.  Copy program files into somewhere on your path, e.g.
    `/usr/local/bin`:

        sudo cp faux-gnome-screensaver.py faux-gnome-screensaver-command.py /usr/local/bin

5.  Make program files executable and link to their non-faux names:

        cd /usr/local/bin
        sudo chmod a+x faux-gnome-screensaver.py faux-gnome-screensaver-command.py
        sudo ln -s faux-gnome-screensaver.py gnome-screensaver
        sudo ln -s faux-gnome-screensaver-command.py gnome-screensaver-command

6.  Open **Startup Applications** (`gnome-session-properties`) and add
    an entry:

        Name: Screensaver
        Command: gnome-screensaver
        Comment: I'm too sexy for my screensaver

    faux-gnome-screensaver will start XScreenSaver so there is no need
    to add an entry for XScreenSaver.

7.  Log out and log back in to start faux-gnome-screensaver.

## Configuration ##

Open **Screensaver** (`xscreensaver-demo`) to configure XScreenSaver
(time to enable, time to power off display, etc.).

## Credits ##

Based in part on:

*   The script in a comment for [bug 528094][] by cpaul
*   XScreenSaver inhibit code from [Caffeine][]
*   ConsoleKit / systemd-logind listening code from
    [GNOME Screensaver][] and its [Ubuntu branch][]
